Voco turning customers into brand ambassadors by encouraging them to recommend & discuss products they love to their friends and family.

== Description ==

VOCO virally & automatically boosts sales.

Shortly after a customer purchases an item, VOCO automatically sends a survey.

If the response on the survey is positive, then the customer is asked to share the product or the store with his friends & family.

* Customers and their friends are automatically rewarded if friends & family have followed and purchased on the shared store. They do not need to purchase the same item, rather they could purchase any item in the store to be rewarded.

* Reward amount is set by the vendor on VOCO dashboard, as a flat rate or as a percentage of products’ price.

* VOCO automatically tracks all referrals and purchases, and distributes the rewards to customers and their friends.

* Setup is simple and quick. Install the plugin and our support will advise about the survey and help complete the setup.
